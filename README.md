Repository for my Arma 3 mod
This is the repository for my Arma 3 mod, feel free to look at the code, I plan on improving once I integrate CBA and probably ACE.

Here you can find the math for the gas exposure
https://www.geogebra.org/calculator/nkrjehzb

Planned features
More gas types
More parameters for gas effects
More delivery methods
More modules
More customization options

Current bugs:
Vehicles (even quad bikes) will shield units from gas, this will be adressed later by separating CBRN resitant vehicles.
Some other unkown ones.
